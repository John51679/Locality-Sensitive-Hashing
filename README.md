# Locality Sensitive Hashing
This project was created as part of "Multidimensional Data Structures" subject in Computer Engineering &amp; Informatics Department (CEID) of University of Patras. It involves the creation of the LSH algorithm with the use of the k-shingles and bloomfilter techniques for the calculation of the similarity between two documents. This project was implemented using `Python` language.

The file `Multidimensional_data_structures.py` acts as the main program. The user inputs the directory that contains all documents, and then the LSH similarity is calculated for all possible document combinations of two.
